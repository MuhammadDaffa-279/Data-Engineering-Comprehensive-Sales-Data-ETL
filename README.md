## Project Information
***Background:***   
This project will create a pipeline from the comprehensive sales data and will perform several tasks including fetching the data, cleaning the data, inserting data to database, and finally generate visualization to create an insight about the dataset.

The goal is to extract actionable insight from the data to understand sales trend. The project will examine data from multiple angles, including sales segmentation, top-performing area, leading products, historical sales pattern, shipping methods, and total sales by category.

The insight generated will be valuable for various stakeholders, such as the sales, marketing, and supply chain departments, helping them refine their strategies. Our aim is to ensure high-quality supply for top categories and item, while achieving increase in Annual Sales.
