Conceptual Problems to provide comprehensive knowledge related with data engineering
=================================================

1. General overview of NoSQL:
Answer : NoSQL (Not Only SQL) is a non tabular database, so this is different from relational database. NoSQL store data differently 
compared with normal relational database. In SQL, the main types in storing the data is in document, key value, wide column,
and graph. Thus, it will be providing much more flexible schema and faster queries.

2. Jelaskan kapan harus menggunakan NoSQL dan Relational Database Management System!
Answer: We use NoSQL when we have dynamic schema, scaling without shutting down the system (horizontal scaling), require
faster query (fast-paced) and handling complex data system. On the other hand, we use relational database when we already
have a fixed schema and requirements to process strong data consistency.

3. Sebutkan contoh 2 tools/platform NoSQL selain ElasticSearch beserta keunggulan tools/platform tersebut!
Answer: First popular platform in NoSQL is MongoDB. MongoDB is very popular because the platform is easy to use and can perform
several queries. The second popular tools/platform is Apache Cassandra. This platform can handle large amount of data 
from several servers. The strong point of Apache Cassandra is its fault tolerance, it provides strong reliability and 
uptime when the time of failures.

4. Jelaskan apa yang Anda ketahui dari Airflow menggunakan pemahaman dan bahasa Anda sendiri !
Answer: Airflow is tools/platform used for managing data pipeline. It can process several integrated defined task in DAG,
scheduling, and maintain/monitoring the process through its web interface. It is a very powerful tools for performing ETL 
tasks by Data Engineers.

5. Jelaskan apa yang Anda ketahui dari Great Expectations menggunakan pemahaman dan bahasa Anda sendiri!
Answer: Great Expectation is a python library that provides several data validations. It is a very powerful tools as it provides
a more reliable data through some data validations. Data processed in the ETL will then be verified its integrity using this
tools 

6. Jelaskan apa yang Anda ketahui dari Batch Processing menggunakan pemahaman dan bahasa Anda sendiri (Definisi, Contoh Kasus Penggunaan, Tools, dll)!
Answer: Methodology to process data as bulk / not real time processing. Data is first stored and collected for some time before
processing it. Usually it process the data that is not require to be processed real time. Batch processing is a scheduled process
within a timeframe scheduling (e.g weekly/biweekly/monthly). Example of batch processing is in payroll system, when the company will collect
information such as work day, overtime etc before finalizing the payroll. Popular tools in batch processing is Apache Spark.
